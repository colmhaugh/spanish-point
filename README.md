### Features Left to Implement

- In the footer, the weather icon is in place, in the furure this would be linked to a site and would update to the correct up to date weather.
- With permissions from the businesses, all links would go to the correct sites.  Currently they are placholders pointing to google.
- Buttons are currently linked to google as a placeholder, these would be updated too.

## Testing 

Testing was done early and often.  I uesed the devices in devtools to check how it would look on samller devices.
I tested my mobile device, Samsung 20 ultra
Most of the ealry testing was done using Google Developent tools.

### Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.
