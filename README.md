### Features Left to Implement

- In the footer, the weather icon is in place, in the furure this would be linked to a site and would update to the correct up to date weather.
- The links for the coast lodge is not secure so they are currintly pointing to google.
- Buttons are currently linked to google as a placeholder, these would be updated so the user can book a tee time and book surfing lessons.

## Testing 

Testing was done early and often.  I uesed the devices in devtools to check how it would look on samller devices after every push as part of my regression testing.
I published early so i could test on mobile phone every eveining after a push.

Most of the ealry testing was done using Google Developent tools.
