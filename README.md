## Testing 

Testing was done early and often.  I uesed the devices in devtools to check how it would look on samller devices after every push as part of my regression testing.
I published early so I could test on mobile phone every eveining after a push.
I tested my mobile device, Samsung 20 ultra and on iPad.
Most of the early testing was done using Google Developent tools.
Issues were fixed as they appeared.

# Issues fixed

- I had in issue where the images for the hotels in the food and drink page.  The image was showing up while I was testing but not when I was testing on the live site.  I used google develpoer tools to inspect and discovered that i had added an extra dot so it was looking for the image in the wrong location.  It was img src="../assets/images/  and once i changed it to img src="./assets/images/ it worked.
- While testing on smaller devices, the ""Welcome to Spanish Point" overlay text didnt look good on smaller devices.  I made the hero-text display to none so it wouldnt appear on phones.  
- I also made the hero-text higher on tablets so it would look better.
- There was not enough room on small devices for the 3 hotels to appear in a row so i put them in a column.
- Some images were loading slowly so i lowered the quality of the image.

# Further testing
- The Website was tested on multiple browsers including Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge and Safari browsers.
- The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, Samsung S20 Ultra, iPhone 11 & iPad.
