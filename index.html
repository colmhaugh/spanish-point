                <h2>Welcome to Spanish Point</h2>
                <br>
                    <p>Spanish Point (Irish: Rinn na Spáinneach) is a small resort in the parish of Milltown Malbay in County Clare on the west coast of Ireland.  
                        It’s so named because of the Spaniards who were buried here after the wreck of their Armada ships along the coast in 1588.
                        One of the ships was wrecked on the reefs to landward of Mutton Island (3km/2 miles) off shore. More than a thousand men were lost, 
                        and many of their bodies were carried by the tide to Spanish Point. Today, you can hire a currach in the fishing village of Quilty and visit the site of the wreck.
                        
                    </p>
